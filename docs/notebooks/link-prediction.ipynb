    "In this set of lectures, we'll study an important task in network data science: **link prediction**. [Link prediction was popularized as a task in network analysis and machine learning by @liben2007link]{.aside} The link prediction task is to, given a current network and possibly some additional data, predict future edges. This task has many applications: \n",
    "\n",
    "- In scientific tasks, we may not be able to collect data on all the edges that we are interested in. If we can develop a model that allows us to predict missing edges, we might be able to learn something about the overall network structure even from partial data. \n",

    "*Positive* coefficients indicate that larger values of the feature make edges more likely, while negative coefficients indicate the opposite. There's a lot to take in, but let's focus on some of the big picture highlights: \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the first five features all have positive coefficients. This indicates that an edge is more likely between two nodes when: \n",
    "    - Each node has higher degree. \n",
    "    - Each node has higher PageRank. \n",
    "    - The two nodes share many common neighbors. \n",
    "It's interesting to note that the coefficient of the number of common neighbors is *so* much higher than the coefficients for the individual node degrees. According to our model, adding 5 neighbors to each node in a pair has less of an impact on the likelihood of an edge than adding a single neighbor that is *shared* by both of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, while the community features can be a little hard to interpret, the thing that sticks out is that the features with the most positive coefficients are the ones in which both nodes belong to the same community. This tells us that edges are more likely to exist between nodes in the same community, which makes sense -- this is pretty much guaranteed based on how modularity maximization defines communities in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "It's all well and good to fit our model on training data and interpret the coefficient, but this doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the ability of our model to make *predictions* about the future. To do this, we need to look at our test data. In this case, it's important that we pass the test data through the same preprocessing as we did before, adding negative examples and feature columns. Very importantly, we pass the graph `G_train` and the community labels `comm_dict_train` as an argument to `compute_features` in order to ensure that things like degree, PageRank, and community structure are calculated using only training data, not testing data. Using testing data to construct the features would be cheating!\n"

Tighter communities could just mean that the platform is better at helping people connect to their interests, and in some cases this might be harmless. On the other hand, such tight communities also smack of echo chambers; in cases related to opinion exchange or debate, it might be difficult for people to actually encounter contrary opinions in this setting. Equality of influence might seem like a good thing, but could also indicate that people with extreme or repugnant viewpoints have become mainstreamed. So, while it's clear that the algorithm has significantly changed the overall structure of the social network, it's important to think about this in specific contexts in order to determine whether this is a bad thing or not. \n",
